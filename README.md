# Frontend quiz builder
I am not a JS or any other frontend language developer.
But maybe, will be useful for someone.

Create you own quiz by simple changing base of test.

- Changable base of tests. Shuffling 1 time. When base is stored in local storage.
- Saving input state in local storage.
- Multi-block quiz.
